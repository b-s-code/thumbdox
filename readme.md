# ThumbDox

The ThumbDox is a (WIP) split keyboard based on the [ErgoDox](https://www.ergodox.io/).

My aims in producing ThumbDox:

1.  Eliminate most of the keys I don't use.
2.  Retain the two 2U thumb keys.
3.  Document the design and production of the keyboard.  Many existing projects are similar, but I could not find anything exactly like what I wanted.  Perhaps showing my process here may save someone else reinventing the ThumbDox.
