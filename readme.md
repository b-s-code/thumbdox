# ThumbDox

The ThumbDox is a (WIP) split keyboard based on the [ErgoDox](https://www.ergodox.io/).  My aims in producing it:

1.  Eliminate the many keys I do not use.
2.  Retain the two 2u thumb keys, in their current position, which are very comfortable for me to use.
3.  Document the design and production of the keyboard.  Many existing projects are similar, but I could not find anything exactly like what I wanted.  Perhaps showing my process here may save someone else reinventing the ThumbDox.
